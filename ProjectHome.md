Project moved to: https://github.com/yuip/hfss-api/

## Intro ##
The original version is from https://www.cresis.ku.edu/~rvc/projects/hfssapi/doc/hfss-matlab-api.html

When I started my PhD I needed to use it. But it lacked some features I needed, so I created this project to improve it a little bit and to share the code with everyone out there.

Shortly after that, I moved to use other stuff so I don't currently use HFSS and its Matlab API. Any new contributions are due to other people. If you want to contribute new features or fix bugs, drop me a line.

Another project forked from the original: https://bitbucket.org/jacobblock/hfssmatlabapi/overview
